PySubBox is a utility --more specifically, a Python script-- for
searching, downloading and watching your YouTube subscriptions without 
visiting YouTube it self.

DEPENDANCIES:
	
	* python (tested only under 2.6)
	* python-gdata
	* clive 			- for downloading videos from youtube
	* mplayer 			- for video playback

TERMINOLOGY:	

	"local index" - a directory contianing various sub-directories used
					for containing "media" and "meta" files.

USAGE:

	python subbox.py (update|search|(download|play videoID, ...)) [options]
	
		--index-dir can be used to specify which local index to use.
		Defaults to ~/Videos/Subscriptions
	
		update
		
			Fetches the specified user's subscription feed and updates
			a local index with newly uploaded videos.
			
			Requires -u|--username , -p|--password and --limit options
			to be set.
			
			--limit determines the number of videos to fetch from each
			channel feed. Defaults to 0.
			
			An optional --start-index can also be set to an integer
			value which will indicate which video to start from. 1, the
			default, is the most recently uploaded. Useful if you want
			to backdate your index; just set an arbiturary largish 
			number.
			
		search
		
			Searches the local index against a given query. The video
			title, category and tags are all taken into account. Returns
			a serious of lines in the format
			
				" - VIDEO_ID [*] VIDEO_TITLE"
				
			indicating those that matched the query. The conditional
			asterick signifies whether there is a media file associated
			with the video entry. i.e. whether it's been downloaded yet.
			
			Requires -q|--query to be set. Set to "" to list entire
			index.
			
			The search can be customised by setting the --limit and/or
			--threshold options.
			
				--limit truncates the number of results returned to the
				value provided. e.g. --limit=5 shows only the best five
				results.
				
				--threshold sets the 'strictness' of the search relative
				to the 'best match' result. As in, the higher the value,
				theoretically, the less results that match the query.
				
				Should be a value in the range 0 to 1.
				
		download
		
			Downloads the actual video file from YouTube via clive[1].
			
			An optional --resolution option can be set to a string in 
			the format "width x height" (No spaces or quotation marks.)
			which is transformed into a clive "format" argument. If
			there is no exact match between the given resolution and
			a valid clive format argument, a best match will be used.
			Clive format arguments may be given instead of a resolution.
			
			If multiple video IDs are specified, they'll be downloaded
			concurrently.
			
		play
		
			Plays back a video file via mplayer[2].
			
			If multiple video IDs are specified, they'll be played
			sequencially.
